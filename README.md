# 🔍 Pyth Hermes Decoder – TypeScript Project

This TypeScript project interacts with the [Pyth Network](https://pyth.network) to fetch and decode real-time price feed updates from their [Hermes API](https://hermes.pyth.network). It converts raw binary (hex) calldata into human-readable JSON price data, and can re-encode a selected subset of price updates for custom broadcasting or relaying.

## 📦 Features

- ✅ Fetch latest price feed data from Hermes (Pyth)
- 🔍 Decode binary (hex) data into human-readable JSON
- ✂️ Slice updates and re-encode a subset (e.g., only first 5 tokens)
- 🧩 Fully modular and typed using TypeScript
- ⚡ Uses efficient buffer parsing with `Buffer` and `bn.js`
